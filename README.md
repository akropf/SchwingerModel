# Schwinger Model and Quantum Computing
## Contribution
This ongoing project is part of the mentorship program of the [Quantum Open Source Foundation](https://qosf.org/).
The Mentor of this project is [Alba Cervera-Lierta](https://albacl.github.io).
## Abstract
Quantum field theories are the mathematical description of the physical world and underlie the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM). Quantum computers bear the possibility of contributing to progress in fundamental particle physics. With this project, the Lattice Schwinger model is chosen to explain the fundamental steps underlying QFT theories. The goal is to show, using the Schwinger model, how quantum field theories can be simulated on a quantum device with using descriptions and language suitable for those without a background in particle physics and quantum fiel theories.
*ongoing:* This will be added as a pdf, and is under review
## Part I: The Schwinger Model
In this section, the prerequisites for understanding the Quantum Field Theory concerned in the Schwinger Model, Quantum Electrodynamics, are given. Then, Lattice Field Theories and the Schwinger Model are explained.
## Part II: Quantum Computing 
**ongoing:** All necessary basics of Quantum computing are explained.
## Part III: Implementation
**ongoing:** Putting section I and II together, the Schwinger Model is implemented.
