## Introduction
In particle physics, one burning question concerns the structure of matter. Matter is broken into small, fundamental, indivisible building blocks, like Lego pieces, which are called 'elementary particles'. Then, the basic interactions that govern those building blocks are analyzed. <br />
Today, there are many beliefs on how matter actually looks like: Are those building blocks the smallest possible pieces? Can you go further and peel layer after layer away similar to an onion? Is matter actually a tiny string of energy? These questions are far from being answered.<br />
However, particle physicists have found a model that has been remarkably successful in predicting most experimental results concerning the particles, phenomena, and interactions we see in the real world.  This model is called 'the Standard Model of Particle Physics', or SM for short, and was formulated in the 1960s. Under the SM, there are 18 kinds of particles, so 'types' of Lego pieces and they can come in certain variations, which in the Lego analogy would be color or stackability, resulting in 61 total pieces.  <br />
The elementary particle building blocks are six 'types' of quarks, which stick together in groups (three for example to form a proton or a neutron), three types of particles called 'neutrinos', and the particles electron, muon, and tau. They are distinguished due to the intrinsic properties they have, such as mass and charge, and the interactions they are involved in.
They all have their own anti-particle, which looks the same but has the opposite charge. Everything we see in the world is made out of a variation of those particles, from atoms to space radiation! <br />
The variations they can be found in depend on the intrinsic properties they possess, for example, each quark can have one of three types of charges, called 'color' charge, referred to as blue, red, or green (this has nothing to do with real colors, its just a name). But there's more!  The SM can describe three out of the four forces in the world and assigns each of those forces a unique, own type of particle, which mediates this interaction.  Those mediation particles are called bosons are the resulting required particles of the SM. You can find an overview of all the types of elementary building blocks for matter and interaction here:<br />

As you probably know, two electrons repel each other. But why is that? In particle physics, we know that the force between them is mediated by a boson. In this case, the boson is a photon, which is nothing else than the tiniest unit (or 'quantum') of light. As crazy as it sounds, the electrons now exchange photons and as a result, they get pushed away from each other. You can think of it as two electrons shooting 'photon' billiard balls at each other, and therefore, they get pushed in the opposite direction.<br />
Fortunately, the SM can describe not only electron repulsion but close to every interaction in the world. <br />
It can describe Electromagnetism, which explains both electricity and magnetism, it can describe radioactive decay which is mediated by something called the weak force, and it explains why quarks like to stick together in groups, and why protons and neutrons stay together to form an atomic nucleus. This latter force is called the 'strong' force because while it only acts on a very small scale, it is 10<sup>38</sup> times as strong as gravitation. By the way, where is gravitation? The SM does not yet include gravitation and has therefore not yet found a boson which is exchanged in the attraction of  masses. <br />
However, this is not the only deficit of the SM, so the SM is believed not to be the ultimate theory. Indeed, it falls short in explaining some phenomena such as 'dark energy' or  universe expansion and involves about twenty fundamental parameters, the values of which are not given by the model itself but have to be determined by experiment. <br />
The SM is rather believed to be a 'low-energy' approximation of the fundamental 'Theory of Everything', similar to the Newtonian theory, which is a low-energy approximation of Relativity. This low-energy approximation yields reliable predictions for interaction processes in the highest currently accessible energy scale of up to 200 GeV at collider facilities. Now, to find a complete model, the Standard Model has to be probed by experiments or simulations to determine in which direction it has to be extended. This can be done in a variety of experimental ways, e.g., at accelerators such as the one at Cern, in non-acceleration experiments such as the neutrino detector Kamiokande or by measuring observables in radioactive decay with high precision.<br />
Another way is to take a closer look at the theory underlying the SM and finding a way of simulating certain interactions or phenomena and comparing them to real-world effects.  
With the rise of quantum computers, a new, unique, and probably superior way of simulating theoretical predictions of the SM is possible. However, the theory underlying all the nice interactions and characterizations named above is based on quantum field theories, and a particle-dependent set of rules, confinements, and challenges. Those quantum field theories have to be broken down into simulatable models, and we have to abide by the characteristics imposed by the quantum computer we use. Unfortunately, the mathematics behind quantum field theory is tricky and burdensome, and not easy to summarize. To understand the potential and challenges of simulating such a quantum field theory, the notorious 'Schwinger model' is explained and implemented in the most simple terms. The Schwinger model is based on one of the named interactions, namely Electromagnetism, and therefore the quantum field theory called 'Quantum Electrodynamics'. To grasp this model, we'll need a set of prerequisites. <br />
## Wave-Particle Duality
If we look at matter at small scales (nanoscale), it does not behave like anything we have seen in classical mechanics.  It additionally behaves, as Feynman put it, in an un-commonsensly kind of way. That is, particles sometimes behave like localized particles, and sometimes like waves. For example, the electron was supposed to behave like a particle, which it sometimes does, but then suddenly it acts as if it was a wave all along, overlapping with other electron waves and exhibiting interference patterns. However, it is found in either state, as a localized particle or as a wave, never in both at the same time.<br /> So what exactly is it then? Broadly stated, it is neither. The bad news is that the interpretation of the so-called wave-particle duality is still heavily discussed and there is no clear answer, however, mathematically, we have a pretty good understanding. In the following, we look at the wave description of the particle.<br />
More precisely, the matter-wave,  
*Ψ*(*x*, *t*), where *x* is the position and *t* is the time, completely specifies a quantum state, for example, an electron.<br />  Additionally, we can describe the change in time of the (non-relativistic) matter-wave using the so-called **Schrödinger equation**, again without understanding what exactly the interpretation of the wave is. This means that if we know what the wave-function looks like and know about the Schrödinger equation, we have the mathematical description of the quantum state AND can describe the temporal dynamics of the state. We want to go further now and look at an electron. We actually want to know the probability to find the electron at a certain position. The first problem we run into is that we deal with continuous variables, meaning that if we take out one position between *0* and *1*, we have an infinite set of possibilities (*0.1* is a position, but so is *0.01*, *0.001*, and so on). That means the probability of finding the particle at any exact location inside this interval is expected to be zero. This is why we do not search for a particle at an exact position, but rather inside an interval, so [0, 1], or more generally, [x, x+dx]. The probability associated with the interval is called the **probability density**.<br />

Now, we thus want to find a connection between probability density and our electrons wave function. On aspect about waves are their magnitude. So, if you think of a basic sine wave, it has peaks and valleys. The so-called **probability amplitude** is nothing else than the height or magnitude of the wave, which can also be negative and is a complex number. <br />Since our wave-function describes the full state, the probability of finding our electron inside a certain interval has to be connected to the wave functions properties somehow. Of course, the total probability is not allowed to change over time, because the probability to find the electron somewhere is always 100%. This brings **Borns rule** into play, which postulates one of the key quantum mechanical relations, namely:
<br /> <br />probability density = \|probability amplitude\|<sup>2</sup>,<br /><br />  a postulate so important that it won Born half of the Nobel price in Physics.
## Spin
One intrinsic characteristic of a particle is its spin, which is unrelated to anything in classical mechanics. Basically, particles were found to possess a magnetic moment, which was explained by deducing that particles have a intrinsic, quantized angular momentum referred to as spin (see: Stern-Gerlach experiment). However, since the particle is point-like, it is not a spinning motion of a ball-like object, and there is simply no classical analogy to visualize the spin of a particle. It is given (and often expressed as) a dimensionless spin quantum number *s*.
There are two particle 'categories': fermions, which possess half-integer spin quantum numbers, such as *1/2, 3/2, ...*, and bosons, which possess integer spin quantum numbers, *0, 1, 2*, and so on . Note that in this regard, particle means either elementary particle, such as electrons, or composite particles, such as protons (which consist of quarks).<br />
Electrons are spin-*1/2* particles, and are therefore fermions, and photons are spin-1 particles, meaning they are bosons. Dependent on the category, a particle either follows the Dirac-statistic (fermions) or the Bose-Einstein-statistic (bosons), which, in a broader sense, means that particles from each group follow a different set of rules. For fermions, an important rule holds, the so-called **Pauli-Exclusion-Principle**. This means that two identical fermions, for example two electrons, cannot occupy the same state in a shared quantum system. <br /> In the case of the electron, there a two orientations possible, so +*1/2* or *-1/2*, which are often referred to as spin up with an up-arrow and spin down, with a down-arrow. If two electrons are in the same orbit around an atom, they cannot have the same spin direction (so up-up or down-down), due to the Pauli principle, so they would either be found in the state up-down or down-up. 

## Helicity and Chirality

After we have accepted that particles possess an intrinsic characteristic called spin, which is difficult to imagine, we can tackle a new concept called helicity}.
In the graphic below, you can see a particle with around its axis marked in red. Additionally, the particle moves in the direction indicated by the black arrow. Now, if you align your right thumb with the black direction arrow, your fingers wrap in the direction of the spin, so in the direction of the red arrow. This means that the particle is **right-handed**. Similarly, in the second picture, the spinning direction is reversed, while the moving direction stays the same. You now have to align your left thumb for your fingers to wrap in the spin direction, meaning the particle is **left-handed**. The handedness is also referred to as the **helicity**. For every fermion, there is a right- and a left-handed version. <br />
The particles we consider have a mass, and mass indicates we have to consider references frames and relativity. Let's say we sit on a train and travel next to an enormous electron. The electron moves faster than we do, moving further and further away from us. <br />
Now the train suddenly travels way faster so we catch up with the electron and even outpace it. From our perspective, the electron now travels in the opposite direction, while the spinning direction remains the same. As you can verify with your thumbs, the particle now has the opposite handedness. This is unfortunate news since that means our measurement of the helicity depends on the velocity difference between us and the particle.<br />
So helicity is not an intrinsic quality, opposite to spin, since we can measure different values if we change our reference frame.<br />
Massless particles are different, though, because they travel at the speed of light. Since the speed of light is postulated to be the fasted possible speed you can travel with, we cannot boost past such a mass-less particle, meaning we will always measure the helicity to be the same.<br />
Nonetheless, we want to find an intrinsic value related to the helicity but that does not change if we move faster. The good news is that this intrinsic property exists, and it is called **chirality**. The bad news is that it is not easy to visualize. Particles have either left- or right-handed chirality, however, it does not change dependent on our reference-frame. For massless particles, helicity and chirality is the same. 

## Two-Component Spinors
Fermions, for example electrons, have  half-odd integer spin (spin- *1/2*, ...) as explained above. In field theory, **spinors** are our mathematical representation of fermions.  Often, we use so-called four-component Dirac spinors. The primary motivation for this is that Dirac spinors are the irreducible representations of massive fermions. Fortunately, we can decompose the four-component Dirac into a pair of two-component spinors, 
*Ψ* = (*u*<sub>+</sub>, *u*<sub>−</sub>)
where *u*<sub>+</sub>, *u*<sub>−</sub> are called **Weyl** or **chiral spinors**. This allows us to work directly with *σ*-matrices (Pauli matrices), instead of *γ*-matrices.<br />
## Gauge fields
Since we now understand what we are generally dealing with, we can take a look at Quantum field theories, or QFT in short. QFT is obscure enough for it to not have a clear interpretation. If we consider one or two electrons, for example, we can look at Quantum mechanics and gain a considerable insight of the system. However, we need QFT to extend it reasonably to the analysis of many particles, meaning we gain a considerable amount of degrees of freedom. If we do not only look at particles, but also at fields, like magnetic field, Quantum mechanics fails to deliver. QFT is then used to give a uniform framework in which both multiple particles and field can be considered. There are a few characteristics and tricks to QFT, which we will discuss superficially for a better understanding. Lets start with fields.<br />
Field theory plays a major role in particle physics. A field is nothing else than finding values for each point in space and time, whatever this means dimensional-wise. For example, a weather-map is a field. We receive, for example, temperature information for every place considered in the map. Field cannot only be build around vector or scalars, but can represent other mathematical quantities like tensors (algebraic objects) and spinors, which we are concerned about.

We now want to look at the dynamics of a field, how the field changes over time or if we fine-tune certain variables. For this, we need to parts. First, we somehow have to find a description on how the dynamics of the field behaves, and we want to define the rules which constrain our dynamics. <br />
### QED
In classical physics, electricity and magnetism are described using a set of differential equations, called Maxwell equations. However, to be in accord with the principles of quantum mechanics which were developed afterwards, Maxwell's theory had to be changed. The subsequent created theory is called Quantum electrodynamics (QED) and is a quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force. The Maxwellian theory can be seen as a classical limit to QED, again similar to the Newtonian theory being an approximation of Relativity theory. This means that those equations Maxwell proposed are not wrong, it just depends on what scale and magnitude we look at. Today, QED is highly accurate at predicting experimental outcomes, and is the fundamental for all phenomena of the physical world except the gravitational effect and nuclear physics.      

## Fermion Doubling problem
If we now want to numerically simulate fermions (or field theories in general), the intuitive approach is to simply put them on an lattice with lattice spacing *a*.<br />
Unfortunately, difficulties arise if we start discretizing fermions (by putting individual fermions at a fixed place). For one, a phenomenon called **fermion doubling** appears, meaning if we straightforwardly put individual fermions at fixed places, suddenly nonphysical states arise if we do the maths (link to maths). We quickly run into problems if we let *a* to *0* (continuum limit).<br />
In that limit and with dimension *d*, we gain an additional amount of 2<sup>*d*</sup> fermionic fields, broadly meaning states are duplicated for every spacetime dimension. In case of our system (1+1 dimension), for every  physical state, we gain 2<sup>*2*</sup> (all states)-1 (physical state) =3 nonphysical states.<br />
There are a few ways to get rid of the nonphysical states that appear, with every method connected to certain drawbacks, like being numerically demanding. Just to name a few, we can construct so-calles Wilson-fermions, or we consider overlapping fermions. The Schwinger model, however, uses somthing called staggered fermions.<br />

## Staggered Lattices 
Since we do not want to run into the Fermion Doubling problem, we use staggered fermions which can be described in multiple ways. Basically, we take the mathematical description of a fermion, the two-component spinor, and "spread" it on two sub-lattices, endowed with staggered signs. "Spread" is in quotations marks, because it is just one way of imagining staggered fermions to look like. Generally, they are apart by the distance *a*, and only correspond to the same location in spacetime if we take the continuum limit *a* to *0*. Thus, in the continuum limit, the parts recombine to the full Dirac spinors (or Majorana spinors). Now the way the gauge field enters is through parallel transport operators on links between lattice sites. They represent the degrees of freedom of the gauge field between the different lattice sites.
